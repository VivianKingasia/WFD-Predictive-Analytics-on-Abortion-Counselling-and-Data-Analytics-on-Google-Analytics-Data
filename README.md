WFD Predictive Analytics on Abortion Counselling and Data Analytics on Google Analytics Data

## BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE

Abortion selfcare is giving the power to women. Women First Digital empowers women with information through its many websites 
to understand abortion selfcare and properly address their needs for good reproductive care. In this case, the woman full understands
and is in control of the process with and without the involvement of a healthcare provider. In this project, data was collected
from the self2choose website on the users interaction with the website in a bid to acquire more information on abortion services.
A predictive algorithm will be built that predicts the status of the enquiries made by users to ensure that they are getting effective
services through their enquiries. 

##  Objectives

- Build a predictive algorith that will predict the likelihood of an enquiry being closed or open. The algorithm with the lowest 
  RMSE will be used.
- Determine patterns within the data.

## Evaluation Metric

Using RMSE or logloss with the lowest one being the best model predictor. RMSE measures average difference between values predicted
and actual values.

## Conclusion

- Most of the queries on the website tended to be resolved.
- Most users are not handled by actual agents. Perhaps since most prefer to reach out via chats, they interact with automated chat bots rather than actual agents.
- Top 5 cities with the highest number of individuals who have accessed the website are Lima, Estado de Mexico, Puebla, Accra and Nairobi.
- This explains why the two most spoken languages by users are Spanish and English.
- Biggest reasons that consumers establish contact are to seek abortion services and to seek pills.
- Biggest reason consumers were not referred was because they dropped off the chat or conversation.
- Biggest reason for users being referred was to access pills.
- Estado de Mexico, Delta State Asaba and Nairobi seem to be the cities struggling with highest resolution time of their cases.
- There was a spike in access to webite between mid November and early December. This needs to be examined.
- Age-group 18-24 years shows the higher user access to the website.
